Version: 1.0.0

### Why?

This should simply be a datapack, but there is an [open issue](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-153392) as of 1.14.2 concerning the deletion and modification of villager NBT data. As this data can't be changed through commands, I've opted to make this mod in the meanwhile.

### Supported versions

* Fabric (1.16.4-1.16.5)
* Forge (1.16.5)

_If you would like to build this for earlier versions, feel free to pull this down and build for the appropriate Minecraft version._
